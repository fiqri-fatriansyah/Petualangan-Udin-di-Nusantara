\viewkind4\uc1\pard\fi180\li90\cf1\f0\fs20 Udin went through the passage that was blocked by Butho Ijo and found the city's gate. When he passed through the gate, surrounding guards looked at him in bewilderment, asking how he got through the giant that was standing just outside the gate. Udin told them that he got rid of Butho Ijo and immediately after the guards were patting his back and shaking his hands, hailing him as some sort of hero.
