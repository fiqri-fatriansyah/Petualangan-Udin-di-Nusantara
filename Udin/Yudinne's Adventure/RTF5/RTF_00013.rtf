\viewkind4\uc1\pard\fi180\li90\cf1\f0\fs20 Udin went back to the forest on the outskirt of Kawali. He tries to get into Kawali to deliver the message but is blocked by Butho Ijo the giant. Here was hit bluntly by Butho Ijo unto the surrounding tree and lost conciousness. He woke up to find himself waking up near the artefact in Kawali's outskirt. On the artefact is now engraved "To never give up is the spirit of the people of this land. For as long as you never yield, the world would one day yield." Udin realized that the artefact was actually actively preventing his demise and somehow reverted time. Udin needs to think of a different way to pass through.
