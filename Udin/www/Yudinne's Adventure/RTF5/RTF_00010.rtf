"Sir?" She asked. Udin snapped out of his daze and began nervously introducing himself. He then proceeded to ask about the woman and the area. The woman then introduced herself as Dayang Sumbi much to Udin's surpise. Dayang Sumbi then explained that the forest they're in is actually really close to the city of Kawali although none of the city dwellers ever inch near the forest. The reason for this is because recently a giant reside near the edge of the forest leading to the city. The city guards can repel the giant away but it kept blocking the passage for those who needs to go outside the city through that gate. Dayang sumbi then said that the giant goes by the name of Butho Ijo.\par
