\viewkind4\uc1\pard\fi180\li90\cf1\f0\fs20 Udin was treated to yet again a small feast. This time around with the king of Sunda kingdom and his daughter Citaloka. As told by stories, Citaloka was indeed a beauty exuding a noble aura. The king as questions about how Udin "vanquished" the giant but Udin merely jest about how he had bested the giant in combat. Udin then presented the king with Hayam Wuruk's message. After reading the message the king appeared to be delighted at the news. He said that had Hayam Wuruk not ask for her daughter's hand in marriage, he would have married her off to some random relative of hers. Udin glanced at Citaloka's face and she doesn't look as happy as her father. Udin was again given a lodging within the palace to rest before the king sends him back to Trowulan.\cf0\par
