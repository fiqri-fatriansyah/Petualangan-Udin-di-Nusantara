Gajah Mada then showed up to support Udin in his words and that Hayam Wuruk's next visitation to Sunda kingdom could be used to get to know Citaloka and see if she's to his liking. Hayam Wuruk that was sceptical towards Udin's words decided to follow it anyway if Gajah Mada says so. Hayam Wuruk then look at Udin and told him to act as his messenger to announce his coming to Sunda kingdom's capital of Kawali since it was his idea although Gajah Mada is supportive of it. Hayam Wuruk then impart upon him a parchment with a message for the Sunda kingdom, several strings of copper coins, and his own Kris dagger as proof of the message's legitimacy.\cf0\par
